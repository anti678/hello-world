# hello-world
This is my first repository and contains my first project ever that I created for my dad's local dentistry.

Hello, my name is Tim. I have always been interested in learning more about computers and how they function and decided to learn about front-end development from Code Louisville. My first project is a website for my dad's local dentistry, he already had a website but it wasn't technically "mobile friendly" and he wanted to make some changes so I decided to try and make an entire new one myself that is both mobile and tablet friendly.
